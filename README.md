# Modularization
Improving iOS build times with modularization involves breaking down your project into smaller, more manageable modules. This approach allows for parallel development and builds, reducing dependencies and speeding up compilation times. Here's how to improve iOS build times with modularization:

Modular Architecture:

Analyze App Features: 
Review the features and functionalities of your iOS app. Identify distinct areas of functionality such as user authentication, data management, UI components, networking, and business logic.
Group Related Features: 
Group related features together to form cohesive modules. For example, authentication-related functionality can be grouped into an Authentication module, while networking-related functionality can be part of a Networking module.
Identify Reusable Components: 
Identify common functionalities or components that can be reused across different parts of your app. Extract these components into separate reusable modules.
Manage Dependencies: 
Define clear dependencies between modules. Ensure that modules only depend on the functionality they need and avoid unnecessary dependencies to minimize coupling.


Optimize Build Settings:

Experiment with Xcode build settings for each module to optimize compilation times.
Adjust optimization levels, compiler flags, and other settings to find the best balance between build time and performance.
Optimize Build Settings: 
Review Xcode build settings to ensure optimal configuration for your project.
Build Settings Customization: 
Experiment with build settings like SWIFT_DETERMINISTIC_MODE, SWIFT_WHOLE_MODULE_OPTIMIZATION, and SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE to find the best configuration for your project.

Incremental Builds:

Enable incremental builds in Xcode to avoid recompiling unchanged files.
Leverage precompiled headers and module caching to speed up the compilation of commonly used code.
